    <h1>Terminology and GAI</h1>
    <!-- LOC NOTE: Author name typically remains unchanged, but some markets might require transliteration -->
    <p>By Alaina Brandt</p>
    <p>In today’s rapidly evolving technological landscape, understanding how we communicate and make meaning is more crucial than ever. This exploration focuses on two intersecting fields: terminology science - the study of how humans understand and label concepts - and generative artificial intelligence (GAI). By examining these areas together, we can better understand both the challenges and opportunities in human-machine communication.</p>
   
    <!-- LOC NOTE: Throughout the contents, specialized terminology from the fields of translation, terminography, knowledge representation and machine learning. The appropriate equivalents for technical terminology needs to be used in the translations.  -->

    <h2>Fundamentals of Terminology Theory</h2>
    <p>The work of terminology is typically used to ensure quality in activities like writing, translation and interpreting. For those who are in the business of communicating with humans, terminology is an important topic to understand. To understand why, we can examine the Semantic Triangle, a model that illustrates human understanding. Also known as the Triangle of Meaning, the ideas presented in the semantic triangle are simple enough.</p>
    
    <ul class="content-list">
        <!-- LOC NOTE: List markers might need adjustment for RTL languages -->
        <li>In one corner of the triangle we have <b>objects</b> - anything perceived or conceived per <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/79077.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ISO 704</a>.</li> 
        <!-- LOC NOTE: ISO standard references should be checked for local language versions if available -->
        <li>Another corner is for <b>concepts</b>, or the abstraction in the mind of humans of concepts.</li>  
        <li>In another corner we have <b>designations</b>, or the words in languages that are used to label abstractions of objects.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These items tied together is how humans make meaning of the world around them. Still, as I point out in the article “<a href="https://alainambrandt.locessentials.com/getting-started-with-terminology-management/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Getting Started with Terminology Management</a>”: “That said, it’s important to remember that just because communities of speakers use common language doesn’t mean that those speakers share the exact same conceptualization of each object that’s designated.” Everyone has their own unique ideas about what makes a physical object a thing and about abstract ideas like friendship and quality assurance.</p>

    <h2>Challenges in Generative AI and Terminology</h2>
    <p>The emergence of textual generative AI has sparked interesting discussions within terminology circles about its implications for the Semantic Triangle (Dr. Sue Ellen Wright, personal conversation 2024). Unlike traditional language use, where words connect to both concepts and real-world objects, textual AI operates solely at the level of designations. It processes language through numerical patterns and similarity clusters, without any true understanding of concepts or connection to real-world references. This fundamental disconnect from the triangle’s conceptual and referential components helps explain why generative AI can produce hallucinations and inaccurate results.</p>

    <h2>Knowledge Graphs: The Solution to Terminology in Generative AI</h2>
    <p>The knowledge graph offers a promising solution to these AI accuracy challenges. A <i>knowledge graph</i> is a structured way of representing special language where real-world concepts and objects become entities (nodes) connected by relationships (edges). Special language is a natural language used in a subject field and characterized by the use of specific means of expression (ISO 1087). When terminology data collected on special language is strategically modeled within such a graph, it can be integrated into generative AI systems to enhance their output quality beyond what's possible with a standard large language model query.</p>

    <aside class="content-aside">
        <p>In 2012, Google revolutionized web searches by implementing knowledge graphs at an unprecedented scale. They launched this feature with the memorable tagline “things not strings,” highlighting the system’s ability to differentiate between concepts that share the same name – for instance, distinguishing between a jaguar the animal and Jaguar the car company. For those new to knowledge graphs, Google’s article <a href="https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-knowledge-graph-things-not/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Introducing the Knowledge Graph: things, not strings</a> provides an excellent primer through both text and visuals.</p>

    <h2>Terminology and Textual GAI: Conclusions</h2>
    <p>Key advantages of using terminological knowledge graphs with GAI include:</p>
    <ol class="content-list">
    <!-- LOC NOTE: Numbered list format might need adjustment for some locales -->
        <li>Improved accuracy through structured relationships between concepts</li>
        <li>Better handling of ambiguous terms through explicit context</li>
        <li>Enhanced ability to verify information against established knowledge</li>
        <li>More reliable cross-language terminology mapping</li>
    </ol>
