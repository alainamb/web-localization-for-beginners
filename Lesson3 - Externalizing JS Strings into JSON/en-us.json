If asked to draw their conceptualization of a table, no two individual speakers of a language will draw the same one from the mental inventory of those they’ve encountered or imagined in their lives.

Meaning truly is in the eye or brain of the beholder.” (Alaina Brandt, Getting Started with Terminology Management, The ATA Chronicle)",
