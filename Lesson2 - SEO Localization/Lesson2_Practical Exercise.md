# SEO Localization: Practical Exercise
Work individually or in groups to create a list of keywords and search intents in English for the United States for a product or service from Mexico.

## Step 1 - Choose a product or service that has not yet been localized that is sold from a website.
Look for a product or service from Mexico.

## Step 2 - Conduct research to produce a list of 5-10 keywords and search intents for the site in both Spanish and English.
You can complete step two manually or by using keyword research tools. In total, you will need to identify between 10-20 items (5-10 in Spanish and 5-10 in English) in order to perform a comparison later.

### Manual Research Method
- **Google autocomplete suggestions** - Type terms related to your product in the Google search bar and observe the automatic suggestions that appear. These suggestions reflect popular searches from real users in Mexico.
- **"People also ask" and "Related searches" sections in Google** - Analyze these sections that appear in search results to identify common questions and related terms that Mexican users are searching for.
- **[Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/)** - Free tool that allows you to compare the popularity of search terms over time in different regions of Mexico. You can identify seasonal trends, compare similar terms to see which is more popular, and discover related terms that are gaining popularity in the Mexican market.
- **Structure of Wikipedia articles for terminology relevant to the topic** - Review Wikipedia articles in Spanish on topics related to your product to identify terms and jargon used in Mexico.
- **Analysis of competitor websites** - Examine Mexican websites of similar products or services to identify terms and phrases they use to attract local customers.

### Keyword Research Tools
- **[Google Keyword Planner](https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/7337243?hl=en-US)** - This free Google Ads tool allows you to see the search volume and competition for specific keywords in Mexico. You can filter by geographic location to get data relevant to the Mexican market. *Note: Although it is possible to access the tool without payment, you need to create a Google Ads account, and more detailed data is limited for accounts without active campaigns. Users without active campaigns will see search volume ranges instead of exact numbers. The initial setup process may be somewhat complex for beginners.*
- **[Ubersuggest - Free Version](https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/)** - Provides limited free searches that would be sufficient for a class activity without requiring account creation. It offers keyword ideas, search volume, and SEO difficulty level.
- **[AnswerThePublic - Free Version](https://answerthepublic.com)** - Useful for finding questions that people ask about specific topics, organized into categories such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. This helps you better understand search intents.

## Step 3 - Prepare your SEO Localization Report.
- Create a document titled "SEO Localization Report: {Product Name}"
- Include the names of all team members (if applicable)
- Structure your report with the following sections:
1. **Introduction:** Present the selected product/service and include the URL of the original site
2. **Spanish keywords and search intents:** List the 5-10 keywords and search intents identified for the US market
3. **English keywords and search intents:** List the 5-10 keywords and search intents identified for the Mexican market
4. **Comparative analysis:** Compare the keywords in both languages, highlighting cultural, linguistic, and search behavior differences between the markets
5. **Justification:** For each English keyword, explain why it is relevant to the U.S. market and how it reflects local search intents
6. **Recommendations:** Suggest how to implement these keywords in different SEO elements (meta tags, headers, content, etc.)
7. **Works cited:** List all sources and tools used in your research
